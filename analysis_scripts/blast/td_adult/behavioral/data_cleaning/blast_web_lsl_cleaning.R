#  Adapted from An's script lsl_clean_file.Rmd
#  Can be used for cleaning both random and predictable 2afc lsl raw files
#  ****************************************************************************

#Added in checking for multiple keypresses in one trial, only the first keypress was kept for each trial
#Added in cleaning for 800ms-letter and 200ms-blank
#The number of people doing LSL randomized 2afc is the same as that experienced LSL 800-200ms exposure phase
#(seems the two changes happened at the same time, need to be double checked by JH)
#Added in checking for how many files have 800ms-long presentation for letter and 200ms-long for blanks
#To do: R markdown file needs to be compiled
